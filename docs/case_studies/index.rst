   * - **Description**
     - A representative example of a |br|
       Permian system. Nearly identical |br|
       to treatment demo, but with |br|
       reduced CAPEX options.
     - A very small, toy-sized network. |br|
       Useful for testing and debugging.
     - Larger network, but "small" in the |br|
       sense that disposal and pipeline |br|
       expansion are not allowed, so the |br|
       model solves quickly.
     - Larger network, and disposal and |br|
       pipeline expansion are allowed. |br|
       Takes a bit longer to solve. This |br|
       can be seen as the "default" case |br|
       study for the strategic model.
     - Network developed for use in |br|
       PARETO workshops. Solves quickly.
     - Generic case study for the |br|
       operational model. Note that this |br|
       case study cannot currently be run |br|
       in PARETO UI - it can only be run |br|
       using the Python command line |br|
       interface.

       additional storage sites (S03 and S04) |br|
       are unused in the baseline scenario, |br|
       but are included in the input file so |br|
       they can used in the beneficial reuse |br|
       scenario (which builds off of the |br|
       baseline scenario).

.. [#] In the strategic model, external completions pads can be used to model opportunities for water sharing outside of the main network.
.. [#] In the strategic model, disposal capacity expansion is only allowed for SWD sites for which the initial disposal capacity is 0.
