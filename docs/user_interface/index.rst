User Interface
==============

The PARETO User Interface (UI) provides a way for users to develop and interact with PARETO models without any familiarity or experience with writing code. 
Using the UI, users can provide sample or custom input data, run custom optimizations, and view detailed visual outputs with comparison and override abilities.
