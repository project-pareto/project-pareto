Operational Water Management
============================


Overview
--------

Given a fixed network of pads (completion and/or production), storage tanks, water forecasts (both consumption and production), and distribution options (trucks and/or pipelines), the operational water management model provides insight into the operational costs associated with water management. The operational model allows the user to explore the tradeoff between minimizing costs (distribution, storage, treatment, disposal, etc.) and maximizing reuse water.

Operational Model Mathematical Program Formulation
---------------------------------------------------

The default objective function for this produced water operational model is to minimize costs, which includes operational costs associated with procurement of fresh water, the cost of disposal, trucking and piping produced water between well pads and treatment facilities, and the cost of storing, treating and reusing produced water. A credit for using treated water is also considered, and additional slack variables are included to facilitate the identification of potential issues with input data.

Operational Model Water Quality Extension
---------------------------------------------------
An extension to this operational optimization model measures the water quality across all locations over time. As of now, water quality is not a decision variable. It is calculated after optimization of the operational model.
The process for calculating water quality is as follows: the operational model is first solved to optimality, water quality variables and constraints are added, flow rates and storage levels are fixed to the solved values at optimality, and the water quality is calculated.

.. note:: Fixed variables are denoted in purple in the documentation.

Assumptions:

* Water quality at a production pad or completions pad remains the same across all time periods
* When blending flows of different water quality, they blend linearly
* Treatment does not affect water quality

**Storage Site Water Quality** ∀s ∈ S, w ∈ W, t ∈ T

The water quality at storage sites is dependent on the flow rates into the storage site, the volume of water in storage in the previous time period, and the quality of each of these flows. Even mixing is assumed, so all outgoing flows have the same water quality. If it is the first time period, the initial storage level and initial water quality replaces the water stored and water quality in the previous time period respectively.

**Treatment Site Water Quality** ∀r ∈ R, w ∈ W, t ∈ T

The water quality at treatment sites is dependent on the flow rates into the treatment site, the efficiency of treatment, and the water quality of the flows. Even mixing is assumed, so all outgoing flows have the same water quality. The treatment process does not affect water quality

.. _model_terminology:

Operational Model Terminology
-----------------------------

**Beneficial Reuse Options:** This term refers to the reuse of water at mining facilities, farms, etc.

**Completions Demand:** Demand set by completions pads.  This demand can be met by produced water, treated water, or freshwater.

**Completions Reuse Water:** Water that meets demand at a completions site. This does not include freshwater or water for beneficial reuse.

**Network Nodes:** These are branch points for pipelines only.

.. note:: Well pads are not a subset of network nodes.

**[t]:** This notation indicates that timing of capacity expansion has not yet been implemented.

**Terminal Storage Level:** These are goal storage levels for the final time period. Without this, the storage levels would likely be depleted in the last time period.
