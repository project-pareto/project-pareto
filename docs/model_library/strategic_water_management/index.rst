Strategic Water Management
==========================

Overview
--------

Given a set of existing network components (completion pads, storage pads, production pads, and distribution options like trucks and/or pipelines) and capacity expansion options, the strategic water management model provides an insight into financial opportunities and mid-long term investment decisions to reduce operational costs or maximize reuse or reduce fresh water consumption.

.. _strategic_model_terminology:

Terminology
-----------

**Beneficial reuse options:** This term refers to the reuse of water at mining facilities, farms, etc.

**Completions demand:** Demand set by completions pads.  This demand can be met by produced water, treated water, or freshwater.

**Completions reuse water:** Water that meets demand at a completions site. This does not include freshwater or water for beneficial reuse.

**Network Nodes:** These are branch points for pipelines only.

.. note:: Well pads are not a subset of network nodes.

:math:`[\textcolor{blue}{t}]` **or** :math:`[\textcolor{blue}{t \in T}]` **:** This notation indicates that timing of capacity expansion has not yet been implemented.

**Terminal storage level:** These are goal storage levels for the final time period. Without this, the storage levels would likely be depleted in the last time period.

**Water boosting:** Moving large volumes of water requires water pumps. Water boosting refers to the infrastructure required to maintain water pressure.

Strategic Model Mathematical Program Formulation
------------------------------------------------


**Objectives**

Two objective functions can be considered for the optimization of a produced water system: first, the minimization of costs, which includes operational costs associated with procurement of fresh water, the cost of disposal, trucking and piping produced water between well pads and treatment facilities, and the cost of storing, treating and reusing produced water. Capital costs are also considered due to infrastructure build out such as the installation of pipelines, treatment, and storage facilities. A credit for (re)using treated water is also considered, and additional slack variables are included to facilitate the identification of potential issues with input data. The second objective is the maximization of water reused which is defined as the ratio between the treated produced water that is used in completions operations and the total produced water coming to surface.

**Annualization Rate Calculation:**

The annualization rate is calculated using the formula described at this website: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eac.asp. 
The annualization rate takes the discount rate (rate) and the number of years the CAPEX investment is expected to be used (life) as input.

.. math::
    \textcolor{green}{\alpha^{AnnualizationRate}} = \frac{\textcolor{green}{rate}}{(1-{(1+\textcolor{green}{rate})}^{-\textcolor{green}{life}})}


**Completions Pad Demand Balance:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in CP}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

If the completions pad lies outside the system, the demand is optional. Otherwise, if the completions pad is within the system, completions demand must be met.
Demand can be met by trucked or piped water moved into the pad in addition to water in completions pad storage.

For :math:`t > 1`:

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{L_{p,t}^{PadStorage}} = \textcolor{red}{L_{p,t-1}^{PadStorage}} + \textcolor{red}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageIn}} - \textcolor{red}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageOut}}


**Completions Pad Storage Capacity:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in CP}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

**Production Pad Supply Balance:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in PP}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

**Completions Pad Supply Balance (i.e. Flowback Balance):** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in CP}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

All flowback water must be accounted for.  For each completions pad and for each time period, the volume of outgoing water must be equal to the forecasted flowback produced water for the completions pad.

.. math::

    \textcolor{green}{\beta_{p,t}^{Flowback}}

        + \textcolor{red}{S_{p,t}^{Flowback}}


**Network Node Balance:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{n \in N}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

Flow balance constraint (i.e., inputs are equal to outputs). For each pipeline node and for each time period, the volume water into the node is equal to the volume of water out of the node.

.. math::

    \sum_{l \in L | (l, n) \in LLA}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,n,t}^{Piped}}

There can only be flow in one direction for a given pipeline arc in a given time period. Flow is only allowed in a given direction if the binary indicator for that direction is "on".

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{y_{l,\tilde{l},t}^{Flow}}+\textcolor{red}{y_{\tilde{l},l,t}^{Flow}} = 1

.. note:: Technically the above constraint should only be enforced for truly reversible arcs (e.g. NCA and CNA); and even then it only needs to be defined per one reversible arc (e.g. NCA only and not NCA and CNA).

.. math::

For each storage site and for each time period, if it is the first time period, the storage level is determined by the initial storage and storage inputs and outputs.
Otherwise, the storage level is determined by the storage level in the previous time period and storage inputs and outputs.
Water outputs include other system nodes (i.e., pipeline nodes and completions pads) and an evaporation stream.

For :math:`t = 1`:

    \textcolor{red}{L_{s,t}^{Storage}}
        = \textcolor{green}{\lambda_{s,t=1}^{Storage}}

For each storage site, the storage in the last time period must be less than or equal to the predicted/set terminal storage level.

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{L_{s,t=T}^{Storage}} \leq \textcolor{green}{\theta_{s}^{Storage}}


**Network Node Capacity:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{n \in N}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

Flow capacity constraint. For each pipeline node and for each time period, the volume should not exceed the node capacity.

.. math::

    \sum_{l \in L | (l, n) \in LLA}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,n,t}^{Piped}}
        \leq \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{n}^{Node}}


**Pipeline Capacity Construction/Expansion:**

Sets the flow capacity in a given pipeline during a given time period. The set :math:`\textcolor{blue}{D}` should also include the 0th case (e.g. 0 bbl/day) that indicates the choice to not expand capacity.
Different constraints apply based on whether a pipeline is allowed to reverse flows at any time. Thus, the following constraint applies to all pipelines that allow reversible flows:

:math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{(l,\tilde{l}) \in LLA}, \textcolor{blue}{(\tilde{l}, l) \in LLA}, [\textcolor{blue}{t \in T}]`

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{F_{l,\tilde{l},[t]}^{Capacity}} = \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{l,\tilde{l}}^{Pipeline}}+\textcolor{green}{\sigma_{\tilde{l}, l}^{Pipeline}}+\sum_{d \in D}\textcolor{green}{\delta_{d}^{Pipeline}} \cdot (\textcolor{red}{y_{l,\tilde{l},d}^{Pipeline}}+\textcolor{red}{y_{\tilde{l},l,d}^{Pipeline}} )+\textcolor{red}{S_{l,\tilde{l}}^{PipelineCapacity}}

The following constraint applies to all pipelines that do not allow reversible flows:

:math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{(l,\tilde{l}) \in LLA}, [\textcolor{blue}{t \in T}]`

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{F_{l,\tilde{l},[t]}^{Capacity}} = \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{l,\tilde{l}}^{Pipeline}}+\sum_{d \in D}\textcolor{green}{\delta_{d}^{Pipeline}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{l,\tilde{l},d}^{Pipeline}}+\textcolor{red}{S_{l,\tilde{l}}^{PipelineCapacity}}

.. note::

    While popuplating the input data into the spreadsheet for initial pipeline capacities, users must use the following guidelines.

    1. For uni-directional pipelines, the initial pipeline capacity must be populated only in the direction of flow else, it will be ignored by the model.

    2. For bi-directional pipelines, the initial pipeline capacity should be populated for only one of the allowable flow directions, not both. The pipeline capacities are aggregated for both directions, so the choice of direction for the capacity is irrelevant.

.. note::

    :math:`\textcolor{green}{\delta_{d}^{Pipeline}}` can be input by user or calculated. If the user chooses to calculate pipeline capacity, the parameter will be calculated by the equation below where :math:`{\textcolor{green}{\kappa_{l,\tilde{l}}}}` is Hazen-Williams constant and :math:`\omega` is Hazen-Williams exponent as per Cafaro & Grossmann (2021) and d represents the pipeline diameter as per the set :math:`\textcolor{blue}{d \in D}`.

    See equation:

    .. math::

        \textcolor{green}{\delta_{d}^{Pipeline}} = {\textcolor{green}{\kappa_{l,\tilde{l}}}} \cdot \textcolor{blue}{d}^{\omega}


:math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{(l,\tilde{l})} \in \textcolor{blue}{LLA}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{F_{l,\tilde{l},t}^{Piped}} \leq \textcolor{red}{F_{l,\tilde{l},[t]}^{Capacity}}


**Storage Capacity Construction/Expansion:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{s \in S}, [\textcolor{blue}{t \in T}]`

The following 2 constraints account for the expansion of available storage capacity or installation of storage facilities. If expansion/construction is selected, expand the capacity by the set expansion amount. The water level at the storage site must be less than this capacity. As of now, the model considers that a storage facility is expanded or built at the beginning of the planning horizon.
The set :math:`\textcolor{blue}{C}` should also include the 0th case (0 bbl) that indicates the choice to not expand capacity.

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{X_{s,[t]}^{Capacity}} = \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{s}^{Storage}}+\sum_{c \in C}\textcolor{green}{\delta_{c}^{Storage}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{s,c}^{Storage}}+\textcolor{red}{S_{s}^{StorageCapacity}}

:math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{s \in S}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{L_{s,t}^{Storage}} \leq \textcolor{red}{X_{s,[t]}^{Capacity}}


**Disposal Capacity Construction/Expansion:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{k \in K}, [\textcolor{blue}{t \in T}]`

The following 2 constraints account for the expansion of available disposal sites or installation of new disposal sites. If expansion/construction is selected, expand the capacity by the set expansion amount. The total disposed water in a given time period must be less than this new capacity.
The set :math:`\textcolor{blue}{I}` should also include the 0th case (e.g. 0 bbl/day) that indicates the choice to not expand capacity.

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{D_{k,[t]}^{Capacity}} = \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{k}^{Disposal}}+\sum_{i \in I}\textcolor{green}{\delta_{i}^{Disposal}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{k,i}^{Disposal}}+\textcolor{red}{S_{k}^{DisposalCapacity}}

:math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{k \in K}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. math::

    \sum_{l \in L | (l, k) \in LLA}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,k,t}^{Piped}}
        + \sum_{l \in L | (l, k) \in LLT}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,k,t}^{Trucked}}
        \leq \textcolor{red}{D_{k,[t]}^{Capacity}}


**Treatment Capacity Construction/Expansion:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R}`

Similarly to disposal and storage capacity construction/expansion constraints, the current treatment capacity can be expanded as required or new facilities may be installed.
The set :math:`\textcolor{blue}{J}` should also include the 0th case (e.g. 0 bbl/day) that indicates the choice to not expand capacity.

.. math::

    \sum_{wt \in WT, j \in J}
        (\textcolor{green}{\sigma_{r,wt}^{Treatment}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{r,wt,j}^{Treatment}}
        + \textcolor{green}{\delta_{wt, j}^{Treatment}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{r,wt,j}^{Treatment}})
        = \textcolor{red}{T_{r}^{Capacity}}


:math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. math::

    \sum_{l \in L | (l, r) \in LLA}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,r,t}^{Piped}}
        + \sum_{l \in L | (l, r) \in LLT}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,r,t}^{Trucked}}
        \leq \textcolor{red}{T_{r,[t]}^{Capacity}}


**Treatment Feed Balance:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

At a treatment facility, the inlet raw produced water is combined into a single input treatment feed.

.. math::

    \sum_{l \in L | (l, r) \in LLA}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,r,t}^{Piped}}
        + \sum_{l \in L | (l, r) \in LLT}\textcolor{red}{F_{l,r,t}^{Trucked}}
        = \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{TreatmentFeed}}

**Treatment Balance:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

At a treatment facility, the input treatment feed is treated and separated into treated water and residual water.

.. math::

        \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{TreatmentFeed}}
        = \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{ResidualWater}}
        + \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{TreatedWater}}


**Residual Water:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R}, \textcolor{blue}{wt \in WT}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

The efficiency of a treatment technology determines the amount of residual water produced.

*Residual Water LHS*

.. math::

        \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{TreatmentFeed}}
        \cdot (1 - \textcolor{green}{\epsilon_{r, wt}^{Treatment}})
        - \textcolor{green}{M^{Flow}}
         \cdot (1 - \sum_{j \in J}\textcolor{red}{y_{r,wt,j}^{Treatment}})
        \leq \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{ResidualWater}}

*Residual Water RHS*

.. math::
        \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{TreatmentFeed}}
        \cdot (1 - \textcolor{green}{\epsilon_{r, wt}^{Treatment}})
        + \textcolor{green}{M^{Flow}}
         \cdot (1 - \sum_{j \in J}\textcolor{red}{y_{r,wt,j}^{Treatment}})
        \geq \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{ResidualWater}}


**Treated and Residual Water Balances:**

For all piping or trucking arcs :math:`\textcolor{blue}{(r, l)}` immediately downstream of a treatment site :math:`\textcolor{blue}{r}`, the user must specify whether the arc carries treated water or residual water away from the treatment site. Moreover, 

*Treated Water Balance*: :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R} \ |` there exists at least one arc :math:`\textcolor{blue}{(r,l)}` carrying treated water away from :math:`\textcolor{blue}{r}, \ \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. math::
        \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{TreatedWater}} = \sum_{l \in L | (r, l) \in LLA \text{ and } (r,l) \text{ carries treated water}} \textcolor{red}{F_{r,l,t}^{Piped}}
        + \sum_{l \in L | (r, l) \in LLT \text{ and } (r,l) \text{ carries treated water}} \textcolor{red}{F_{r,l,t}^{Trucked}}

*Residual Water Balance*: :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R} \ |` there exists at least one arc :math:`\textcolor{blue}{(r,l)}` carrying residual water away from :math:`\textcolor{blue}{r}, \ \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. math::
        \textcolor{red}{F_{r,t}^{ResidualWater}} = \sum_{l \in L | (r, l) \in LLA \text{ and } (r,l) \text{ carries residual water}} \textcolor{red}{F_{r,l,t}^{Piped}}
        + \sum_{l \in L | (r, l) \in LLT \text{ and } (r,l) \text{ carries residual water}} \textcolor{red}{F_{r,l,t}^{Trucked}}

.. note:: The user is not required to specify any arcs carrying away treated or residual water immedaitely downstream of a treatment site. In reality, water that enters a treatment site must eventually leave and go somewhere, but for the sake of modeling flexibility, it is not required to include such arcs. If the user chooses to omit downstream treated and/or residual water arcs for a treatment site, then the treatment site acts as a sink within the greater network model for the water which is not propagated downstream.

**Beneficial Reuse Minimum:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{o \in O}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

If a beneficial reuse option is selected (:math:`\textcolor{red}{y_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}} = 1`), the flow to it must meet the minimum required value.

If :math:`\textcolor{green}{\sigma_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseMinimum}} \gt 0`:

.. math::
    \textcolor{red}{F_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseDestination}}
    \geq \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseMinimum}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}}

**Beneficial Reuse Capacity:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{o \in O}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

If a beneficial reuse option is not selected (:math:`\textcolor{red}{y_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}} = 0`), the flow to it must be zero. Furthermore, the specified capacities of beneficial reuse options must be respected.

It is optional to specify capacities (:math:`\textcolor{green}{\sigma_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}}`) for reuse options. If a capcity is provided for reuse option :math:`\textcolor{blue}{o}`:

.. math::
    \textcolor{red}{F_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseDestination}}
        \leq \textcolor{green}{\sigma_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}}
        + \textcolor{red}{S_{o}^{BeneficialReuseCapacity}}

Otherwise:

.. math::
    \textcolor{red}{F_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseDestination}}
        \leq \textcolor{green}{M^{Flow}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{y_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuse}}
        + \textcolor{red}{S_{o}^{BeneficialReuseCapacity}}

**Total Beneficial Reuse Volume:**

.. math::
    \textcolor{red}{F^{TotalBeneficialReuse}}
    = \sum_{t \in T} \sum_{o \in O} \textcolor{red}{F_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseDestination}}


**Fresh Sourcing Cost:** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{f \in F}, \textcolor{blue}{p \in CP}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

For each freshwater source, for each completions pad, and for each time period, the freshwater sourcing cost is equal to all output from the freshwater source times the freshwater sourcing cost.

        = (\textcolor{red}{F_{f,p,t}^{Sourced}}
        + \textcolor{red}{F_{f,p,t}^{Trucked}}) \cdot \textcolor{green}{\pi_{f}^{Sourcing}}

.. math::

Strategic Model Water Quality Extension
---------------------------------------------------
An extension to this strategic optimization model measures the water quality across all locations over time. As of now, water quality is not a decision variable. It is calculated after optimization of the strategic model.
The process for calculating water quality is as follows: the strategic model is first solved to optimality, water quality variables and constraints are added, flow rates and storage levels are fixed to the solved values at optimality, and the water quality is calculated.

.. note:: Fixed variables are colored purple in the documentation.

Assumptions:

* Water quality of produced water from production pads and completions pads remains the same across all time periods
* When blending flows of different water quality, they blend linearly

**Treatment Feed Water Quality** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{r \in R}, \textcolor{blue}{qc \in QC}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

The water quality at treatment sites is dependent on the flow rates and qualities of the feed streams into the treatment site. Even mixing is assumed in calculating the quality of the combined feed stream.

    \leq \textcolor{red}{Q_{r^{TreatedWaterNodes},qc,t}} \cdot \textcolor{purple}{F_{r,t}^{TreatedWater}}



**Network Node Water Quality** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{n \in N}, \textcolor{blue}{qc \in QC}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

The water quality at nodes is dependent on the flow rates into the node and the water quality of the flows. Even mixing is assumed, so all outgoing flows have the same water quality.

.. math::

    \sum_{p \in P | (p, n) \in PNA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{p,n,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\nu_{p,qc,[t]}}
        + \sum_{p \in P | (p, n) \in CNA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{p,n,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\nu_{p,qc,[t]}}

        + \sum_{o \in O | (n, o) \in NOA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{n,o,t}^{Piped}})


**Completions Pad Intermediate Node Water Quality** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in P}, \textcolor{blue}{qc \in QC}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

.. admonition:: Water Quality at Completions Pads

    Water that is piped and trucked to a completions pad is mixed and split into two output streams: Stream (1) goes to the completions pad and stream (2) is input to the completions storage.
    This mixing happens at an intermediate node. Finally, water that meets completions demand comes from two inputs: The first input is output stream (1) from the intermediate step. The second is outgoing flow from the storage tank.

The water quality at the completions pad intermediate node is dependent on the flow rates of water from outside of the pad to the pad. Even mixing is assumed, so the water to storage and water to completions input have the same water quality.

.. math::

    \sum_{n \in N | (n, p) \in NCA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{n,p,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{n,qc,t}}
        + \sum_{\tilde{p} \in P | (\tilde{p}, p) \in PCA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{\tilde{p},p,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\nu_{\tilde{p},qc,[t]}}

        + \sum_{r \in R | (r, p) \in RCA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{r,p,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{r^{TreatedWaterNodes},qc,t}}
        + \sum_{f \in F | (f, p) \in FCA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{f,p,t}^{Sourced}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{f,qc,t}}

        + \sum_{\tilde{p} \in P | (\tilde{p}, p) \in PCT}\textcolor{purple}{F_{\tilde{p},p,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\nu_{\tilde{p},qc,[t]}}
        + \sum_{s \in S | (s, p) \in SCT}\textcolor{purple}{F_{s,p,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{s,qc,t}}
        + \sum_{\tilde{p} \in P | (\tilde{p}, p) \in CCT}\textcolor{purple}{F_{\tilde{p},p,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\nu_{\tilde{p},qc,[t]}}

        + \textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{CompletionsDestination}})


**Completions Pad Input Node Water Quality** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in P}, \textcolor{blue}{qc \in QC}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

The water quality at the completions pad input is dependent on the flow rates of water from pad storage and water from the intermediate node. Even mixing is assumed, so all water into the pad is of the same water quality.

.. math::

    \textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageOut}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{PadStorage},qc,t}}+\textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{CompletionsDestination}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{IntermediateNode},qc,t}}
        = \textcolor{red}{Q_{p,qc,t}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\gamma_{p,t}^{Completions}}


**Completions Pad Storage Node Water Quality** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{p \in P}, \textcolor{blue}{qc \in QC}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

The water quality at pad storage sites is dependent on the flow rates into the pad storage site, the volume of water in pad storage in the previous time period, and the quality of each of these flows. Even mixing is assumed, so the outgoing flow to completions pad and water in storage at the end of the period have the same water quality. If it is the first time period, the initial storage level and initial water quality, respectively, replace the water stored and water quality in the previous time period.

For :math:`t = 1`:

.. math::

    \textcolor{green}{\lambda_{s,t=1}^{PadStorage}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\xi_{p,qc}^{PadStorage}}
        + \textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageIn}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{IntermediateNode},qc}}

        = \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{PadStorage},qc,t}} \cdot (\textcolor{purple}{L_{s,t}^{PadStorage}}
        + \textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageOut}})

For :math:`t > 1`:

.. math::

    \textcolor{purple}{L_{s,t-1}^{PadStorage}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{PadStorage},qc,t-1}}
        + \textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageIn}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{IntermediateNode},qc}}

        = \textcolor{red}{Q_{p^{PadStorage},qc,t}} \cdot (\textcolor{purple}{L_{s,t}^{PadStorage}}
        + \textcolor{purple}{F_{p,t}^{PadStorageOut}})


**Beneficial Reuse Water Quality** :math:`\forall \textcolor{blue}{o \in O}, \textcolor{blue}{qc \in QC}, \textcolor{blue}{t \in T}`

The water quality at beneficial reuse sites is dependent on the flow rates into the site and the water quality of the flows.

.. math::

    \sum_{n \in N | (n, o) \in NOA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{n,o,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{n,qc,t}}
        + \sum_{s \in S | (s, o) \in SOA}\textcolor{purple}{F_{s,o,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{s,qc,t}}
        + \sum_{p \in P | (p, o) \in POT}\textcolor{purple}{F_{p,o,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\nu_{p,qc,[t]}}

        = \textcolor{red}{Q_{o,qc,t}} \cdot \textcolor{purple}{F_{o,t}^{BeneficialReuseDestination}}

Strategic Model Discrete Water Quality Extension
---------------------------------------------------
In the previous chapter a model for tracking the water quality was shown. Without fixing the flows this model is non-linear. By discretizing the number of water qualities for all locations over time we can make the model linear again.

The discretization works as follows.

Take for example this term from the Disposal Site Water Quality:

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{F_{k,t}^{DisposalDestination}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{k,qc,t}}

Both terms are continuous, so this is non-linear.

First we introduce a set, parameter, variables and constraints

**Discrete Water Quality Sets**

:math:`\textcolor{blue}{q \in Q}`			                     Discrete Water Qualities

**Discrete Water Quality Parameters**

:math:`\textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}` = 	        Values for discrete Water Qualities

**Discrete Water Quality Variables**

:math:`\textcolor{red}{Z_{l,t,qc,q}}` =           Binary decision variable for which discrete quality chosen

:math:`\textcolor{red}{F_{k,t,qc,q}^{DiscreteDisposalDestination}}` =           Water injected at disposal site for each discrete quality

**Only One Discrete Quality Per Location** ∀l \in L, t \in T, qc \in QC

For each location in time only one discrete water quality can be chosen for a water quality component.

.. math::
    \sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{Z_{l,t,qc,q}} = 1

**Discrete Max Disposal Destination** ∀l \in L, t \in T, qc \in QC, q \in Q

For each location in time only for one discrete quality there can be water injected at the disposal site and at most the capacity for that disposal site. For all the others it is equal to zero.

.. math::

    \textcolor{red}{F_{k,t,qc,q}^{DiscreteDisposalDestination}} \leq \textcolor{green}{D_{k,[t]}^{Capacity}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Z_{l,t,qc,q}} 

**Sum Flow Discrete Disposal Destinations is Flow Disposal Destination** ∀l \in L, t \in T, qc \in QC

For each location in time the sum of the flows for all the discrete qualities is equal to the actual flow going to the disposal site.

.. math::

    \sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{k,t,qc,q}^{DiscreteDisposalDestination}} = \textcolor{red}{F_{k,t}^{DisposalDestination}}


We can now rewrite the non linear equation showed before to:

.. math::

    \sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{k,t,qc,q}^{DiscreteDisposalDestination}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

Rewriting the whole constraints goes as follows:

**Disposal Site Water Quality** ∀k \in K, qc \in QC, t \in T

The water quality of disposed water is dependent on the flow rates into the disposal site and the quality of each of these flows.

.. math::

    \sum_{n \in N | (n,k) \in NKA}\textcolor{red}{F_{n,k,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{n,qc,t}} +\sum_{s \in S | (s,k) \in SKA}\textcolor{red}{F_{s,k,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{s,qc,t}}+\sum_{r \in R | (r,k) \in RKA}\textcolor{red}{F_{r,k,t}^{Piped}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{r,qc,t}}

    +\sum_{s \in S | (s,k) \in SKT}\textcolor{red}{F_{s,k,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{s,qc,t}}+\sum_{p \in P | (p,k) \in PKT}\textcolor{red}{F_{p,k,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{v_{p,qc,[t]}}

    +\sum_{p \in P | (p,k) \in CKT}\textcolor{red}{F_{p,k,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{v_{p,qc,[t]}}+\sum_{r \in R | (r,k) \in RKT}\textcolor{red}{F_{r,k,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{r,qc,t}}

    =\textcolor{red}{F_{k,t}^{DisposalDestination}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Q_{k,qc,t}}

Can be rewritten as

**Discrete Disposal Site Water Quality** ∀k \in K, qc \in QC, t \in T

The water quality of disposed water is dependent on the flow rates into the disposal site and the quality of each of these flows.

.. math::

    \sum_{n \in N | (n,k) \in NKA}\sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{n,k,t,q}^{DiscretePiped}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

    +\sum_{s \in S | (s,k) \in SKA}\sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{s,k,t,q}^{DiscretePiped}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

    +\sum_{r \in R | (r,k) \in RKA}\sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{r,k,t,q}^{DiscretePiped}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

    +\sum_{s \in S | (s,k) \in SKT}\sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{s,k,t,q}^{DiscreteTrucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

    +\sum_{p \in P | (p,k) \in PKT}\textcolor{red}{F_{p,k,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{v_{p,qc,[t]}}

    +\sum_{p \in P | (p,k) \in CKT}\textcolor{red}{F_{p,k,t}^{Trucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{v_{p,qc,[t]}}
   
    +\sum_{r \in R | (r,k) \in RKT}\sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{r,k,t,q}^{DiscreteTrucked}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

    \leq \sum_{(q) \in Q}\textcolor{red}{F_{k,t,qc,q}^{DiscreteDisposalDestination}} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Q_{qc,q}^{DiscreteQuality}}

The constraints for the DiscretePiped and DiscreteTrucked are similar to the DiscreteDisposalDestination.

.. note:: The = sign in the original constraint is changed to :math:`\leq` sign in the discretized version.
