Strategic Water Management
==========================

Overview
--------

Given a set of existing network components (completion pads, storage pads, production pads, and distribution options like trucks and/or pipelines) and capacity expansion options, the strategic water management model provides an insight into financial opportunities and mid-long term investment decisions to reduce operational costs or maximize reuse or reduce fresh water consumption.

Strategic Model Mathematical Program Formulation
------------------------------------------------


**Objectives**

Two objective functions can be considered for the optimization of a produced water system: first, the minimization of costs, which includes operational costs associated with procurement of fresh water, the cost of disposal, trucking and piping produced water between well pads and treatment facilities, and the cost of storing, treating and reusing produced water. Capital costs are also considered due to infrastructure build out such as the installation of pipelines, treatment, and storage facilities. A credit for (re)using treated water is also considered, and additional slack variables are included to facilitate the identification of potential issues with input data. The second objective is the maximization of water reused which is defined as the ratio between the treated produced water that is used in completions operations and the total produced water coming to surface.

**Annualization Rate Calculation:**

The annualization rate is calculated using the formula described at this website:  http://www.energycommunity.org/webhelppro/Expressions/AnnualizedCost.htm.
The annualization rate takes the discount rate (rate) and the number of years the CAPEX investment is expected to be used (life) as input.

**Completions Pad Demand Balance:** ∀p ∈ CP, t ∈ T

Completions pad demand can be met by trucked or piped water moved into the pad in addition to water in completions pad storage. For each completions pad and for each time period, completions demand at the given pad is equal to the sum of all piped and trucked water moved into the completions pad plus water removed from the pad storage minus water put into the pad storage plus a slack.

.. _strategic_model_terminology:

Terminology
-----------

**Beneficial Reuse Options:** This term refers to the reuse of water at mining facilities, farms, etc.

**Completions Demand:** Demand set by completions pads.  This demand can be met by produced water, treated water, or freshwater.

**Completions Reuse Water:** Water that meets demand at a completions site. This does not include freshwater or water for beneficial reuse.

**Network Nodes:** These are branch points for pipelines only.

.. note:: Well pads are not a subset of network nodes.

**[t]:** This notation indicates that timing of capacity expansion has not yet been implemented.

**Terminal Storage Level:** These are goal storage levels for the final time period. Without this, the storage levels would likely be depleted in the last time period.

**Water Boosting:** Moving large volumes of water requires water pumps. Water boosting refers to the infrastructure required to maintain water pressure.
