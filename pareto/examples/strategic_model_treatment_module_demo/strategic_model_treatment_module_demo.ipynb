    "# PARETO - Strategic Model Treatment Module and Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to give an overview of the features which comprise the water treatment module within PARETO's strategic model, and to show how PARETO can be used to perform sensitivity analysis for produced water networks. This demo makes use of PARETO's Python coding interface. If you prefer a graphical interface, you can download the PARETO GUI [here](https://www.project-pareto.org/software/) (athough we note that some of the features which are used in this demonstration are not supported in PARETO GUI)."

    "The strategic toy case study features a very small produced water network. This network is smaller than most realistic produced water networks, but the small size of this example makes it useful for testing, debugging, demonstrations, etc. Below is a schematic image of the strategic toy network:\n",

For each relevant tab of the input file, we provide a screenshot to give a visual representation of what the data input looks like.\n",

    "The PARETO team conducted a literature review to gather information about produced water treatment technologies. The results of this search have been summarized in an Excel workbook which is available in the PARETO documentation.\n",

    "DISCLAIMER: Some parameters related to water treatment, e.g., costs and efficiency, are highly variable in practice. The data used in this case study should be considered arbitrary, but we would like to mention that the treatment parameter values which have been selected for this demo have been informed by our literature search, and are representative of some real-world water treatment systems."
