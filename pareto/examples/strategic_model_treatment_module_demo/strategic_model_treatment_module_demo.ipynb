    "# PARETO - Strategic Model Treatment Module and Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to give an overview of the features which comprise the water treatment module within PARETO's strategic model, and to show how PARETO can be used to perform sensitivity analysis for produced water networks. This demo makes use of PARETO's Python coding interface. If you prefer a graphical interface, you can download the PARETO GUI [here](https://www.project-pareto.org/software/) (athough we note that some of the features which are used in this demonstration are not supported in PARETO GUI)."

This network is smaller than most realistic produced water networks, but the small size of this example makes it useful for testing, debugging, demonstrations, etc. Below is a schematic image of the strategic toy network:\n",
