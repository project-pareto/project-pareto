    "# PARETO - Strategic Model Tracking Water Quality and Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides an overview of the water quality and treatment module within PARETO's strategic model, highlighting its advanced capabilities for managing produced water networks with water quality constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Water Quality Challenges in Practice: \n",
    "In daily operations, maintaining water quality is crucial to minimizing issues such as corrosion and scaling, while in the long term, it informs treatment technology selection and performance evaluation.\n",
    " \n",
    "PARETOâ€™s water quality module supports: \n",
    "- tracking constituent propagation\n",
    "- capturing water quality fluctuations\n",
    "- Managing and blending water to meet specified quality standards\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates PARETO's capability to track water quality and optimize the produced water network to minimize TDS at specific locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this demonstration is organized as follows:\n",
    "1. [Water quality module data requirements](#data)\n",
    "2. [Set up and solve Pyomo model](#solve)\n",
    "3. [Add additional quality constraints to the model](#additional_constraints)"
