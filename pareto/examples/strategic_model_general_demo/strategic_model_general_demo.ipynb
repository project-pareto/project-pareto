    "## Introduction\n",
    "This demo is based on PARETO's strategic toy case study. Relevant links:\n",
    "- [Strategic model documentation](https://pareto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_library/strategic_water_management/index.html)\n",
    "- [Documentation of PARETO case studies](https://pareto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_studies/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategic toy case study features a very small produced water network. This network is smaller than most realistic produced water networks, but the small size of this example makes it useful for testing, debugging, demonstrations, etc. Below is a schematic image of the strategic toy network:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Strategic toy case study network](strategic_toy_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the strategic toy case study data is arbitrary, but meant to be representative of a real produced water network. We will now proceed with demonstrating all of the steps that are needed to set up and solve an instance of PARETO's strategic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this demonstration will proceed in six steps:\n",
    "1. [Import needed files and libraries](#import)\n",
    "2. [Set up the set list and parameter list](#set_list_and_parameter_list)\n",
    "3. [Load data into Python](#load_data)\n",
    "4. [Build the Pyomo model](#build)\n",
    "5. [Solve the model](#solve)\n",
    "6. [Analyze results](#analyze)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that PARETO includes a file called `run_strategic_model.py` which is a ready-to-go script that can be used to run a PARETO case study with default options. The steps which are described in this notebook are essentially the same as those that are used in `run_strategic_model.py`."
